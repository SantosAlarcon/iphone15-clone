# iPhone 15 Pro Splash Screen Clone

![Cover](cover-iphone15pro.webp)

## Introduction

This page is a clone or recreation of the [iPhone 15 Pro page](https://www.apple.com/iphone-15-pro) made by **React** and uses the **GSAP** for the animations and **ThreeJS** for the 3D Rendering. The only difference with the official page is that you can rotate the 3D model and change the color in realtime.
